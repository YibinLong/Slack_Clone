1. Objective

Build a simple, real-time chat platform that allows users to sign up, join a workspace, create channels, and send/receive text messages in real time. Focus on a minimal viable product (MVP) with persistent messaging and basic real-time updates.

2. Target Users

Solo developer’s testing / early beta

Small teams or personal use

Anyone familiar with Slack-style chat interfaces

3. MVP Scope & Features
3.1 Authentication

Sign up/login with email & password

Passwords hashed (bcrypt)

JWT-based session or cookie authentication

Acceptance Criteria:

Users can register & log in

Auth token/session is required for all protected routes

3.2 Workspace & Channels

Users can create a workspace

Users can create channels within a workspace

Users can join/leave channels

Only members of a channel can see/send messages

Acceptance Criteria:

Workspace creation succeeds

Channels can be created/listed by workspace

Only authorized users see channels/messages

3.3 Messaging

Send/receive messages in real time using WebSocket

Messages persist in PostgreSQL

Messages include sender, timestamp, body

Load last N messages when opening a channel

Acceptance Criteria:

Messages delivered to connected users live

Messages stored in DB and retrievable

Duplicate messages handled gracefully

3.4 Minimal UI

Channel list pane

Chat pane with message history & input box

Messages show sender & timestamp

Optional: typing indicator

Acceptance Criteria:

User can select a channel and see messages

User can type & send messages

Messages appear in correct order

3.5 Database

Tables: users, workspaces, channels, channel_members, messages

Indexed for fast retrieval of messages by channel

Acceptance Criteria:

All entities stored correctly

Messages load in chronological order

4. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: p95 message delivery latency < 200ms for single-server MVP

Security: TLS, hashed passwords, JWT, input validation

Maintainability: Code modular, documented, small files

Scalability (future): Design to add Redis or pub/sub later

5. Tech Stack

Frontend: Next.js / React

Backend: Node.js + Express

Database: PostgreSQL (local or managed)

Real-time: WebSocket (ws or Socket.IO)

Hosting: Local, then Render/Vercel if desired

6. Exclusions (Not in MVP)

File uploads / reactions / threads

Voice/video calls / calls integration

Bots, apps, external integrations

Admin roles / SSO / OAuth (unless optional later)

7. Success Metrics

User can sign up & log in successfully

User can create/join workspace & channels

User can send/receive messages in real time

Messages persist and reload after reconnect

Thin slice (auth → channel → message) works end-to-end

8. Milestones (Solo Dev + AI Approach)
Week	Milestone	Tasks
1	Repo & DB setup	Init repo, add migrations, basic folder structure, install dependencies
2	Auth MVP	Signup/login API, JWT session, hashed passwords, tests
3	Workspace & Channels	Create workspace, create/list channels, membership DB logic
4	Real-Time Messaging	WS server, send/receive messages, persist to DB
5	Minimal UI	Next.js pages: channel list, chat pane, load message history, send messages
6	Hardening & Testing	Reconnect logic, dedupe messages, input validation, TLS/local deployment
7	Optional Extras	Typing indicators, minor UI polish, deploy frontend/backend
